The representation of these themes will be done via recontextualising the personal lyrics of the song to ... in the immediate environment, which the protagonist of the video will interact with. * \u00b7 How and why will you use media language in your cross-media production? Media language should... I will attempt to make use of a mixture of techniques to augment the environment of the video, such as light practical and digital effects -- in order to capture an otherworldly feel. I will also use a varied pace of editing to help punctuate the overarching narrative, a light use of intertextuality, symbolic imagery and a mixture of shot types and locations to help keep the video engaging. I will use colour grading techniques to represent the emotions of each shot e.g. the sad shots will have a blue hue and the angry shots will have deeper black values. \u00b7 How will you target your intended audience? It will appeal to a teen audience as the main actors are teenagers and the alternative music and subtle dark themes (e.g. suicide represented by the bloody hand hanging over the bath, cultist imagery to imply forced changes and oppression) play into current teenage culture where mental health is a large topic of discussion. I will imply suicide through bloody shots but will not outright show any action of self-harm, only the aftermath. The use different paint colours also imply confusion in sexuality in relation to LGBT symbolism of the colours, as well as general confusion linking to the change a teenager goes through in finding themselves and how labels can be applied to them (like the cultists apply the paint). I will mainly use hard cuts to not distract from the subject matter in shot but also to keep the target audience\u2019s attention throughout the video. Lip syncing shots will be intercut with disturbing imagery of blood and voyeuristic POV shots of the female body (ref to Mulvey) to keep attention on the video and create an unsettling feeling in the audience. This links to conventions of the horror genre as they often have a disturbing focus on harming females. \u00b7 How will your production conform to its industry context? By establishing credibility as an indie film/lifestyle magazine and I would absolutely love to and be a fine man My video will conform to industry standards by having the elements of a stereotypical alternative indie song which challenges and creates talk around important societal issues as well as creating a \u2019different\u2019 video which stands out. I will use a mixture of camera angles to create an attention capturing video. For example, I will use lots of mid shots and close ups of my main actor to establish him as the focus and to show emotion through the shots. I will also film in multiple locations to contrast the image of the main character that is presented in each location e.g. depressed in the bath vs at ease in a park. \u00b7 How will your cross-media production demonstrate digital convergence? For the magazine element, I intend to create a lifestyle magazine that is relevant to both my chosen demographic of young adults -- and conforms to its relevant industry context. For this I intend to use a bolder, minimalist design language that bucks some familliar design trends in magazines, and establish its credibility as a magazine for the chosen demographic. Behind the scenes photos of the music video will be used to cultivate interest, and the content itself will be a fairly casually written interview about the song and the video's production. This will be in service to the perception of an artist with a lack of ideological baggage, an important factor to the demographic. I will demonstrate cross-media digital convergence by creating a magazine front cover and double page spread. I will use this to explain the themes of suicide, depression, change and oppression seen throughout the video. I will link this to the artist and any goals or experiences they have when exploring these themes.","title":"Aims and Intentions NEA"},{"location":"Analysis%20Kit/","text":"Analysis Kit \u00b6 ahh, what a fine day for analysis!

There's also a decoding aspect, where we -- the audience -- decide whether we'll go along with it. These codes are communicated either visually or technically. It positions an issue in a way that showcases a message, it's up to you to decide whether or not you agree with that. These don't have to be strictly political. - Codes - In thrillers, enigma codes (secrets and mysteries - clues and red herrings) are put into the text, that wants the audience to continue to watch. - This is contrary to an action code , a type of code that moves the narrative forward. - Cause and Effect - something happens; something reacts - Narrative is pushed forward. After many years of inundation, the meanings of certain codes can be cultivated and agreed upon by society. e.g. A scar on the face of a character (or a russian/bri'ish accent) can function as a hermeneutic code, indicating to the audience that they are \u2018the villain\u2019. 2.

Three stage structure of Narrative Equilibrium - Status quo/Initial Normality/Peace Disequilibrium - Disruption/Conflict/ Characters called the Agents of Disruption New Equilibrium - New normality/Calm/Peace/Partial restoration This would be the standard narrative. This may not happen in all texts, but they can \"play around with those ideas\". There is a more detailed five stage structure of narrative developed later: 1. Exposition 2. Development 3. Complication 4. Climax 5. Resoulution In a nutshell, the implication from this is that all narratives share a basic structure that involves moving between states of equilibrium. This isn't a literal framework to use, we should be using this in a way that compliments the text. 3. Genre Theory - Steve Neale \u00b6 Potentially applies to: All Media \"Genres are instances of repetition and difference.\" - Steve Neale Texts may include standard, expected conventions , but to be successful and survive they must also offer something new. From a strictly prodcer-based perspective, genres are useful for precise and specific audience targeting , where the audience desire for repetition and difference is satiated by the fluidity of genre.

This can be used in a more nuanced way -- saying two things are similar. 5. Post-modernism - Jean Baudrillard \u00b6 Potentially applies to: All Media Postmodernism|Postmodern texts tend to use a level of intertextuality .

Feminism is not a lifestyle choice: it is a political commitment.

Many games have \u2018persistent\u2019 worlds and are multiplayer, meaning that the game world continues even after a player logs off.","title":"More quickfire notes on Games"},{"location":"Video%20Games/#some-more-key-terms","text":"Proliferation is when a successful product is copied relentlessly (a rip off).

This covers the subsection: Component 1 Section A ( #examtechnique ) assessment talking points. Media language \u00b6 Relevant theorists \u00b6 I would wager that every theorist in Media Language - Theory would be applicable here. Golden and nostalgic colour scheme and general aesthetic (even for the time) used to emphasise luxurious and aspirational goals. Cultivates a response of anemoia. The text is unambiguously formally presented . Codes ranging from proairetic to referential are used to this end. (i.e. Engima code of woman's pose on front cover, referential codes to familial architypes and WASP ideology) Authoratative and parasocial lexical field for the Use and Gratification of the audience. (oops that's a bit of audience). (i.e. Lexis like 'amazing', 'comprehensive', 'leisure', 'family', home cookery is 'perfect') Creates an idealistic-feminine focussed hyperreal aesthetic, unconcerned with serious topics . The realm is cut off from the wider informational world . This hyperreality extends to service the nostalgia referrenced earlier. Heavy use of binary oppositions to reinforce potential classist ideology (I told you this was a bit yikes). Even the title and text are opposed, 'realm' forces a juxtaposition between a dominion ruled by women and a dominion where they are the docile subjects (Yikes). Conventions of established magazines up until that point are built upon. Mise-en-scene depicting heavy femenine signifiers.

Despite being a woman's magazine, men are implicitly promoted and catered to throughout. I think it's also important to note this magazine does not pass the Bechdel Test. Middle-class demographic are hardly brought attention to. The constraints of middle class life are often a footnote, dwarfed in size in comparison to the aspirational and proper way of doing things. Reflection of wider historical context, 1 post-war women are working and thus have more obligations 2 and responsibilities. Frequent, highly voyeuristic and highly sexualised images of women in perilous situations. Damsel in distress. Mise-en-scene showcasing running makeup, rope and torture devices represent women in a sexually fetishistic and vulnerable way . Yikes. Challenging or simply sexist? Audience consistently positioned through POV and tracking shots, anchoring the interpretation that they are complicit in the menacing of the women/women in the industry in general. Lack of anchorage however allows producers to sidestep accusations of sexism? Potentially, if unfavourable. Activities \u00b6 If you're viewing this publically, this may be private.

A common criticism of the economic system at the time appeared to be the idea of the 'second-shift' .
