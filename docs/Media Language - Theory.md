### 1. Semiotics - Roland Barthes

^38a854

Yikes.
*Potentially applies to: All Media*

> **Semiotics** - the signifier and signified, encoding and decoding.

Any given text will have some kind of meaning injected within it. In this case, the **signifiers** would be the messsage.
There's also a **decoding** aspect, where we -- the audience -- decide whether we'll go along with it. These codes are communicated **either visually or technically.**

It positions an issue in a way that showcases a message, it's up to you to decide whether or not you agree with that.

These don't have to be strictly political.
- Codes
	- In thrillers, **enigma codes** (secrets and mysteries - clues and red herrings) are put into the text, that wants the audience to continue to watch.
	- This is contrary to an **action code**, a type of code that moves the narrative forward.
		- Cause and Effect - something happens; something reacts
		- Narrative is pushed forward.

After many years of inundation, the meanings of certain codes can be *cultivated* and agreed upon by society.

> e.g.  A scar on the face of a character (or a russian/bri'ish accent) can function as a hermeneutic code, indicating to the audience that they are ‘the villain’.


### 2. Narratology - Tzvetan Todorov
---
*Potentially applies to: All Media*

- Narrative Theory was to do with the **three act structure of narrative**
- Came up in context of a fairy-tale type structure...
	- Three stage structure of Narrative
	1. Equilibrium - Status quo/Initial Normality/Peace
	2. Disequilibrium - Disruption/Conflict/
		1. Characters called the Agents of Disruption
	3. New Equilibrium - New normality/Calm/Peace/Partial restoration

This would be the standard narrative. This may not happen in all texts, but they can "play around with those ideas". There is a more detailed **five stage structure** of narrative developed later:

	1. Exposition
	2. Development
	3. Complication
	4. Climax 
	5. Resoulution
	
In a nutshell, the implication from this is that **all narratives** share a **basic structure** that involves *moving between states of equilibrium.*

This isn't a literal framework to use, we should be using this in a way that compliments the text.

### 3. Genre Theory - Steve Neale
---
*Potentially applies to: All Media*

> "Genres are instances of repetition and difference." - __Steve Neale__

- Texts may include **standard, expected conventions**, but to be successful and survive they must also offer something new.
- From a strictly prodcer-based perspective, genres are useful for *precise and specific audience targeting*, where the **audience desire for repetition and difference** is satiated by the fluidity of genre.
- New genres and old conventions can mix and meld together.

Steve Neale can be applied to Genre if you can *argue that Franchise has become a Genre of sort*. **Franchises are examples of Genre**.

### 4. Structuralism - Calude Levi-Stauss
---
*Potentially applies to: All Media*

Theory of **Binary Opposites**. Things that are diametrically opposed to one another.
-> Designed to propel things forward through the conflicts they make.

> **Example from Beyonce's - Formation**
> Colonialism and Post-Colonialism are diametrically opposed in Beyonce's Formation.
> May be saying that post colonialism and colonialism are similar

Any time a media text has two things that are so obviously opposed they drive attention toward it. This can be used in a more nuanced way -- saying two things are similar.

### 5. Post-modernism - Jean Baudrillard
---
*Potentially applies to: All Media*

[Postmodernism|Postmodern](Postmodernism|Postmodern) texts tend to use a level of **intertextuality**. (Intertextuality is a reference to a different text/current events)

> e.g. Lady Gaga's - Telephone directly references Kill Bill by Tarantino. On purpose narrative meanings.

Comic use counts -- but intertextuality only runs through directly unrelated meanings of textual reference.

(This is not to be confused with what happens when one product advertises another product. That is called **synergy.**)...
