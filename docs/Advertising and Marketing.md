> ## Quick Start
> - There are going to be two main types of advertised media here. [Print Media Advertising | print media](Print%20Media%20Advertising%20|%20print%20media), and [Video Media Advertising | video media](Video%20Media%20Advertising%20|%20video%20media).

## Introduction
Advertising is an *endemic force in the modern world*. We need to be able to analyse the media language and see how advertisers *cultivate* messages to their **target demographics**.  Advertising can take the form of so many media texts, so the [Analysis Kit](Analysis%20Kit) needs to be in full swing.

## Basic Guide to Advertisment Analysis
This follows the **PQE LIE** (Point, Quotation, Explanation, Language, Intention, Effect) that was taught at Schminton Schmillage Schmollege.

1. Analyse the **most obvious things** on the page.
	- Use things like:
		- **Layout** and overall design/aesthetic
		- Page Anchorage and **Composition**
		- Colour, lighting, location, **Mise-en-scene**.
		- **Language** and tone
		- ✨**Narrative**✨ (✨thanks Todorov, bestie <3♥✨) 
		- *Editing*, camerawork, sound, *voiceover*, pace, structure (if it's 🎥)
2. *Engage* with the text and see how it makes you feel. *Rationalise* why I feel that way using the text.
	- This would be looking more deeply:
		- Look at **codes** (gesture, heuristic etc.) and **conventions**
		- This would be a great time to bring in the [Theories](Theories).
		- How do these **elements** combine to make a larger image?
3. Repeat step 1, getting less and less obvious points as you go on.
4. You now basically have an essay with evidence and devices and effect. *Flesh it out* and you're done.
