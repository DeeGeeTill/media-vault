## Radio Engagement Strategies
---
- **Parasocial Relationship** with the radio personality or guests for different viewpoints.
	- Enthusiastic and intimate mode of address
	- Encouragement of *Audience Participation*
		- 10 minute takeover, audience driven content
		- Escapism? [Media Language - Theory#5 Post-modernism - Jean Baudrillard](Media%20Language%20-%20Theory#5%20Post-modernism%20-%20Jean%20Baudrillard) and Hyper-reality. #extensionTheory Utopian Solution theory. By Richard Dyer
	- Recurring Audience identify with them
	- Programmes offer *particular identities*. [Representation - Theory#4 Theories of Identity - David Gauntlett](Representation%20-%20Theory#4%20Theories%20of%20Identity%20-%20David%20Gauntlett). Adorno #extensionTheory talks about pseudo-individualism. [Commodification of identity.](http://samhains.com/blog/mcc/2018/06/16/adorno-pseudo-individualization.html)

- **Familiar Structure** either within the program itself (i.e. phone-in section, debate section etc.) or the context of the program. Hesmondholgh
	- Aural Familiarity
		- Diagetic and non-diagetic sound (dialogue? mode of address)
---
- **Incentives for Listening**
	- Competitions, "In it To Win It", Giveaways, Surprise Rewards
---
- **Use of Narrative** giving Narrative pleasures? [Media Language - Theory#2 Narratology - Tzvetan Todorov](Media%20Language%20-%20Theory#2%20Narratology%20-%20Tzvetan%20Todorov).
---
- **Encoding** as in [Media Language - Theory#1 Semiotics - Roland Barthes](Media%20Language%20-%20Theory#1%20Semiotics%20-%20Roland%20Barthes), are we encoding or decoding. Engima's?

- **Visual representations and Translations** of the programme. Multimedia world, are other media forms accesssible in conjunction with the radio programme? Does this make it more palatable for new media platforms like YouTube.
