### An Analysis...

#### Core Points
These are points you can just whip out at any opportunity when talking about Woman's Realm. This covers the subsection: *Component 1 Section A*  ( #examtechnique ) assessment talking points.


#### Media language
> ##### Relevant theorists
> - I would wager that every theorist in [Media Language - Theory](Media%20Language%20-%20Theory) would be applicable here.


-  *Golden* and nostalgic **colour scheme** and **general aesthetic** (even for the time) used to emphasise *luxurious* and *aspirational* goals. Cultivates a response of [anemoia.](https://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/post/105778238455/anemoia-n-nostalgia-for-a-time-youve-never) 
-  The text is unambiguously *formally presented*.
	-  Codes ranging from *proairetic* to *referential* are used to this end. (i.e.** Engima code** of woman's pose on front cover, **referential codes** to familial architypes and WASP ideology)
-  __Authoratative__ and *parasocial* **lexical field** for the Use and Gratification of the audience. (oops that's a bit of audience). 
	-  (i.e. **Lexis** like 'amazing', 'comprehensive', 'leisure', 'family', home cookery is 'perfect')
-  Creates an idealistic-feminine focussed **hyperreal** aesthetic, unconcerned with *serious topics*. The realm is cut off from the *wider informational world*.
	-  This hyperreality extends to service the *nostalgia* referrenced earlier.
-  Heavy use of **binary oppositions** to reinforce potential *classist ideology* (I told you this was a bit yikes). Even the title and text are opposed, 'realm' forces a *juxtaposition* between a dominion ruled by women and a dominion where they are the docile subjects (Yikes).
-  **Conventions** of established magazines up until that point are built upon.
-  *Mise-en-scene* depicting heavy femenine signifiers.

-  Women are consistently represented as *hegemonically attractive,*  tall, white, christian etc. While there is a different form of *objectification* (distinct from the frequent contemporary *sexualisation*), there is still highly **voyeuristic** content throughout the magazine -- in keeping with beauty norms present in the wider **historical context**.
	-  Despite being a woman's magazine, men are implicitly promoted and catered to throughout. I think it's also important to note this magazine does not pass the [Bechdel Test.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBechdelTest)
-  Middle-class **demographic** are hardly brought attention to. The *constraints* of middle class life are often a footnote, dwarfed in size in comparison to the *aspirational* and *proper* way of doing things.
	-  Reflection of wider historical context,[^1] post-war *women are working* and thus have more obligations[^2] and responsibilities.
-  

-  Frequent, **highly voyeuristic** and **highly sexualised** images of women in perilous situations. Damsel in distress.
-  _Mise-en-scene_ showcasing running makeup, rope and torture devices represent women *in a sexually fetishistic and vulnerable way*.  Yikes.
	-  Challenging or simply sexist?
-  Audience consistently positioned through POV and tracking shots, *anchoring* the interpretation that they are  **complicit** in the menacing of the women/women in the industry in general.

-  Lack of anchorage however allows producers to sidestep accusations of sexism? Potentially, if unfavourable.

- To what extent [is Riptide sexist](is%20Riptide%20sexist) or perpetuating hegemonic ideology?

[^1]: An absolutely amazing book to read for this is called "The Feminine Mystique". It helped kick off second-wave femenism, and is actually a fairly interesting read. If you message me I will give you an extremely legal copy.


[^2]: I'm referencing the start of second-wave feminism here. A common criticism of the economic system at the time appeared to be the idea of the *'second-shift'*. Basically, the quality of life for women declined as they were now expected to work to support the household financially, and take care of children/the home domestically.
