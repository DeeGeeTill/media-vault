### The Opening Sequence:
Credits - black and white, sans-serif font 
- connotations of POLICE font.
- Credits intercut with wheels spinning 
- this spiral motif connotes disorientation and is a motif which continues throughout. It can beread as an intertextual reference to Hitchcockâ€™s â€˜Vertigoâ€™.
- Classic convention - 70s action music.
- Desaturated colour with colour palette of greys and blues - masculine and gritty .
- Title in crosshair - like a rifle sight.
- Setting - high rise flats, terraced houses, bin bags - root it in working class, Northern environment.
- Heavy use of jump cuts (in contrast to straight cuts) to disorient the viewer.
- Generic codes as car pulls up - diegetic squealing of brakes.
-  Police vehicles and uniformed police.
-  Tyler framed dominantly on right, suited with a tie - precise and by the book.
-  Reads rights (generic convention) perfectly - this is a man who does things by the book.
-  Typical situation of raid on suspectâ€™s house, followed by chase. Closed frames within the house  connote entrapment - used throughout the series.
-  Tyler as active protagonist - chase through back alleys, scaling walls. 
-  Use of hand-held camera creates a sense of immersion in the action and this alongside the POV shots, position the audience within the narrative with Sam.
-  Iconography of taser and handcuffs.
-  Police station - building looms over everything as it is shot from a low-angle, connoting the  
power of the law but also its permanence compared to the transient nature of human life (it  
has been there since the 70s and also gives the audience a narrative reference point when we  
see it again). 
- Uniformed police and vehicles are evident. Todorov - cause and effect links - we see this again  
in the parallel but different world of 1973.- The interview room is modern, almost clinical. Tyler arranges pens on table with laptop (21st

when analysing make sure to use editing as well. 

Let's just make as many notes as we can... :)) 
You're doing alright, just keep planning, talking and developing... :)))))

*heh... ironic*
- cluttered office - good enough attitude
- dartboard/trophies/ like a living room rather than a professional office
	-	competitive nature
	-	not always so busy
	-	shoves sam into his achievements owo
		-	OMG THEY'RE SMmmMMMOKING ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜ ðŸ—¯ðŸ‘¿
-	levelled difference between the two
	-	underhand punch
-	window shows the entire department what he's doing.
-	links idea of parody - clearly making links to th epast (dun dun dun dun)
-	when talks about having "hoops" for lunch is a *reference to the sweeny* (missing out on lunch being put in a bad mood).
-	poster is of a sheriff in a cowboy film.

### Represent
-  women in the show take a motherly role to men
-  the difference between the main character of the sweeny and life on mars (CHAD & BASED SWEENY vs CUCK & BETA LIFE ON MARS)
	- over-emotional
	- privilege to be seen as more than that
		- Psychology killer scene. 
	- gender discourse of women in police force, objectified. (Annie). 
	- misogynistic language surrounding her
	- (archaic) objectifying language that dehumanises.
- no male victims in the show at all (hey-o by the way, the only motivation for Sam is the god damn female characters -- there's no other characterisation).

- crying about crime oWo
- conduit-fever
- life on mars is postmodern????? - self awareness surrounding the text. 
- programme articulates a continium that is in progress  (not finished quite yet). 
- characterisation of women, if conforms to expectations -- are rewarded (old woman etc.)
- life on mars is attempting to copy the idea of the 70s instead of the actual reality of the 70s. it overlaps but doesn't finish.
