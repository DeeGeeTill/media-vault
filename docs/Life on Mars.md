You can find a mixture of the raw notes we made *in class* and the notes *provided by the WJEC/Eduqas* specification in the [Life on Mars - Raw Notes | raw notes document](Life%20on%20Mars%20-%20Raw%20Notes%20|%20raw%20notes%20document).

### In Depth [Analysis Kit | Analysis](Analysis%20Kit%20|%20Analysis)
#### The Opening Sequence:
Already in the opening sequence of the show, we can start to see some really pivotal themes come together.

- Mise en Scene
	- (technically sound) conventions of 70s action music in opening.
	- Title is positioned **within a crosshair.**
	- *Setting* has highrise flats and terraced houses, **placing the scene** in a working class, Northern environment.
	- Use of **[Media Language - Theory#3 Genre Theory - Steve Neale | genre](Media%20Language%20-%20Theory#3%20Genre%20Theory%20-%20Steve%20Neale%20|%20genre) codes** *through set dressing and environment* as police chase occurs
	- Tyler wearing formalwear, lending to his *characterisation* as a *straight-laced* by the book individual.
	- Tyler takes the role of an *active protagonist* by chasing through the scene.
	- Iconography of *handcuffs* reinforcing police.
	- Clinical and *modern* interview room with an emphasis on **technology** via the framing.
- Editing
	- The opening credits are in a **black and white**, *sans-serif* font: connoting Police
	- Credit grpahics are intercut with police cars from an impossible *audience-only* low angle.
		- Spiral motif may be [Key Terms#^a72273 | intertextual reference](Key%20Terms#^a72273%20|%20intertextual%20reference) to **Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo**
	- A very "masculine" and "police" and "serious" *colour palette* and *grading*.
	- Use of *jumpcuts* interspersed with *straight cuts* to disorient the viewer.
- Cinematography
	- Our main protagonist, Tyler, framed *dominantly* on the right within the opening few minutes.
	- Use of **canted and low angles** for *dramatic effect*.
	- *Closed frames* during fight and chase scenes. Subject is usually **centrally framed** but fleeting while Tyler is *dominantly framed* and *in focus*.
	- Use of a **handheld camera** and shakycam "immersing" the viewer.
		- **POV Shots** also help to position the audience within the narrative *alongside Sam*.
	- **Establishing shot** of the police station which is filmed like a monolith. *Important as a reference when the issekai happens*.
- Dialogue
	- Fast and *accurate* reading of the arrester's rights (*a [Media Language - Theory#3 Genre Theory - Steve Neale | generic convention](Media%20Language%20-%20Theory#3%20Genre%20Theory%20-%20Steve%20Neale%20|%20generic%20convention) of the police drama*).

This is the kind of framework that should be applied when analysing the show. Each*textual element* serves to build on the **central themes** of the text itself. Namely, it's *nostalgia* (or probably more likely [anemoia](https://bit.ly/3bJHQhu)). 


Let's just make as many notes as we can... :)) 
You're doing alright, just keep planning, talking and developing... :)))))
- cluttered office - good enough attitude
- dartboard/trophies/ like a living room rather than a professional office
	-	competitive nature
	-	not always so busy
	-	shoves sam into his achievements owo
		-	OMG THEY'RE SMmmMMMOKING ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜ ðŸ—¯ðŸ‘¿
-	levelled difference between the two
	-	underhand punch
-	window shows the entire department what he's doing.
-	links idea of parody - clearly making links to th epast (dun dun dun dun)
-	when talks about having "hoops" for lunch is a *reference to the sweeny* (missing out on lunch being put in a bad mood).
-	poster is of a sheriff in a cowboy film.

### Represent
-  women in the show take a motherly role to men
-  the difference between the main character of the sweeny and life on mars (CHAD & BASED SWEENY vs CUCK & BETA LIFE ON MARS)
	- over-emotional
	- privilege to be seen as more than that
		- Psychology killer scene. 
	- gender discourse of women in police force, objectified. (Annie). 
	- misogynistic language surrounding her
	- (archaic) objectifying language that dehumanises.
- no male victims in the show at all (hey-o by the way, the only motivation for Sam is the god damn female characters -- there's no other characterisation).

- crying about crime oWo
- conduit-fever
- life on mars is postmodern????? - self awareness surrounding the text. 
- programme articulates a continium that is in progress  (not finished quite yet). 
- characterisation of women, if conforms to expectations -- are rewarded (old woman etc.)
- life on mars is attempting to copy the idea of the 70s instead of the actual reality of the 70s. it overlaps but doesn't finish.

### Intertextual References: TV Police Dramas
##### The Sweeny
*Try and make conventions of 1970s to 1980s police dramas. OwO.*
- Thames ITV Ident -- localised television
- Bullet sequence, conventions are typical to the point of parody.
- Light blue, car, driver, formal typeface, tame excitement, swinging soundtrack, violent arrest, a GUN?!?!?!?! My, my.
	- Historical context of the audience
	- Renault 16 - Ford Granada

##### The Professionals
- More action oriented, not quite formal, not quite informal.
-"" Modern" technological, identification, 

#### Postmodern
Life on Mars is **postmodern**. Look for where spectacle is foregrounded. It's pastiched and an homage to 1970s. It's intertextual. It's paranoia-fuelled. It has meta-narratives, and isn't chronological. Sam is unreliable as a narrative guide. Bricolage'd over the decade. It's incREDIBLY MAGICALLY REAL. Sam and Gene are an anti-hero.
