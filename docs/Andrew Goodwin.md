# Andrew Goodwin's - Music Video Theory
*'dancing in the disco factory' is the best subtitle for an academic paper i stg*

Andrew Goodwin is a media theorist (with a really good internet security presence because I keep seeing a cricket player), who believes the following components comprise the **core themes** and tenets of operation in a given music video.

*NTS: Use these to inform and start points when possible*

1. Links between music and visuals (literal, amplified or oppositional) 
2. Links between lyrics and visuals (literal, amplified or oppositional) 
3. Genre characteristics 
4. Inter-textual references 
5. Themes of looking and voyeurism 
6. Demands of the record label 
7. Performance, narrative or concept based 

I have examples of these being applied to [RiptideAGW](RiptideAGW) and [FormationAGW](FormationAGW), which are our example texts.
