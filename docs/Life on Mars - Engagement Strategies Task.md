## Engagement Strategies of Life on Mars
#topic/tv #activity

---

- *Cinematography*
	- Scenes:
		- Use of *handheld camera* in police chase, stops and shows children. (Knocks on Raimes' door to alleyway).
			- *Old and new binary opposition.*
- *Representation*
	- Scenes:
		- Maya may have a *negotiated reading*, police officer with shirt unbuttoned etc, kicked off case for *being emotional* and then **is the victim**.
			- *Van Zoonen representation*. Subverts some superficial female tropes but ultimately continues a negative representation.
			- Increased negotiation between 2006 and 2021
			- *This doesn't pass the Bechdel Test!* Episode reliant on patriarchal views. Faux-feminist.
				- Is her representation *enlightened*, **reflective of reality (of the time)** or *regressive*?
				- Equivalent of a *white saviour* character. But for gender. Owo.
				- Does she function as an archetype?
- *Narrative*
	- Todorov may be applied literally?
	- The 5 stage structure can be found literally everywhere, however this is a *postmodern text*
		- Within the narrative, are *meta-narrative* storylines and *fragmented story lines*.
			- Case being solved?
			- Coma or magic?
			- Love interest progression?
	- Don't get much of an equilibrium as genre codes inform thematic truth.
- *Use of Stereotypes and Archetypes*
	- Do these present biaries? Making them extreme to emphasise the binary?
		- Gene Hunt - Masculinity, gender, playing with common stereotypes. 
		- Playing specifically with the audiences' conceptions of these stereotypes. *Shorthand to get us into the text.* Because they're blunt.
		- Cultural referential codes.
		- Sam is a self-insert marysue of the audience, lol noobs get rekt vape naysh harlem shake? that's 2006 lingo right?
		- Links to commodity fetishism - feels as if that group is a part of something for understanding that reference. Uses and gratifications theory.
