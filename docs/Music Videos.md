## Introduction
Music Videos are what we're going to be making for the NEA-type thing at the end of this so I might want to know what they are and how to analyse them. Music videos are basically **convergent** freaks of nature resulting from the *music industry and the television/film industry* merging together. They **function as an advert** for the actual song.

## Analysing a Music Video
Analysing a music video paragraph should rely on the [Andrew Goodwin](Andrew%20Goodwin) framework which I will briefly summarise here:

### Goodwin Paragraph Writing
1. Identify a Goodwinian Element
2. Give a textual example of the element
3. Explain the meaning produced
4. Discuss the impact on the viewer

(Or for what was taught at GCSE, PQE LIE: **P**oint, **Q**uotation, **E**xplain, **L**anguage, **I**ntention,**E**ffect, (an awful acronym actually)).
