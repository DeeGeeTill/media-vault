## I'm going to cry.
This should end up becoming a journal/diary type thing where I can just pick up where I left off in my thought process from *one work session to the next*. I'm hoping this helps me in any way. Although, it is anyone's guess.

#### Journal One - 15/09
As I'm writing this out, I realise that having this be in it's own note would be far better. But, also... consider... I no longer care.

- This slide
- has stuff
- on it

#### Journal Two - 16/09
I think I'm starting to get a better idea of what I'm intending to do for the music video. I've started researching the *aesthetic* I'm hoping to achieve.  I think I'll get a moodboard or similar together.

As for *equipment* and **logistical issues**, I've started a little research there as well. 

```ad-note
- This excellent write up on reddit.
- [Ian Hubert's Patreon](https://kemono.party/patreon/user/2339790) is a great place to go.

#### Journal Three - 24/09
I've been mulling over my idea for a few days now. I've made a basic VFX test (that doesn't look particularly good if I'm honest). The **deadline for Aims and Intentions** is today -- so I've got to get a move on. I've been looking at *music video treatments*; documents that are used to help give production companies an idea of what a video might be.

Also here's what my test looks like:

```ad-note
- There's a [really good collection of treatments by acclaimed director *Kieth Schofield*](http://keithschofield.com/treatments/). ðŸš¨**Warning**ðŸš¨: Ok gorg, his stuff is so fucking weird. Just, be careful. It's a *little traumatising*.
- [MORE](https://www.wedirectmusicvideos.com/treatments) treatments!!

#### Journal Four - 14/10
OK gorg, we're going to need to redealling. The journal has been an NEA fornication.

So, um, now that I've gotten that out of my system, the deadline for the NEA has been moved to a more reasonable date. The time for the deadline has been trying to move along with the article for the things

## Feedback
- **Cover Art**
	- Images will make or break the cover art, choose locations carefully and go for a more sophisiticated, *higher end of demographic* ideals with the aesthetic you choose.
	- Organise a full shoot
	- General vibe and ideas look good, but make sure you think about those images.
	- Article has been with *cokentart* for the lorem ipsum style.
