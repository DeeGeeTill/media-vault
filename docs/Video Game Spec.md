Our **key text** for this unit is the *entire Assassins Creed franchise*. 

Further context can be found at [TvTropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed) and [The Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed). Also [A video that Miss played in class](https://youtube.com/watch?v=S0k2oSu-nSo). (Warning, it's a loooooooooong video.) Really long. I don't like it.

The [Official WJEC Gaming Document](https://resource.download.wjec.co.uk/vtc/2016-17/16-17_1-34/pdf/eng/video-games-overview.pdf) has some really nice resources in it as well.
