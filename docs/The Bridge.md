#### What is Film Noir?
A Noir movie **is "black" in tone**. Themes, such as the emphasis on a fatalistic, despairing universe where there is no escape from mean city streets, loneliness, and death; filmic techniques, such as the emphasis of low-key and *highcontrast lighting, complex compositions, and a strong atmosphere of dread and paranoia; and iconography*, those symbolic images, like the femme fatale, that are freighted with certain meaning transtextually, or across filmic texts.

It's characterised by:
- Contrastic Momentum
	- Chiaroscuro Lighting
	- **Claustrophobic** Framing
		- Takes place in urban places with manmade claustorphobic mise en scene. 
- Characters
	- *Cynical* protagonists
	- *Femme fatale* figures
		- Victims of misogynistic writing lmao
- Themes of
	- **Entrapment**, paranoia, lust, betrayal, **limerance**, jealousy
		- Exploited by the *femme fatale* figure
	- **Existentialist** angst and *ennui* (boredom, apathy, etc.), not for the promotion of those ideals, but for the characterisation of the subjects.
- Auditory Factors
	- **Sonic landscape** of jazz-spirals
		- Contemporary feeling (??? rephrase later)
	- Voiceover from *unreliable narrator* - (postmodern credentials?)

> We watched **Double Indemnity** (insurance scam film) as a film noir text.
> We also watched **The Third Man** (lime's introduction) as another film noir text.

#### What is Nordic Noir? 🐉
- Typically crime dramas, particularly brutal
	- Crimes invading safe community
- Silence and Silent Spaces are a prominent theme
	- Typically wide-open settings like Fjords
	- Contrary to the themes of Psychological Imprisonment
		- Binary with the city
- Psychological motivation/background
	- For anti-hero behaviour
	- Psychological imperialism
		- Construction of a hyperreal scandenavia and hybridity of genre
			- Hybridity intertextually references many other texts - (Reference to THE GLOBAL AGE) giving more of an appeal to international audiences.
- [Bergman-esc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingmar_Bergman) cinema as an intertextual reference

### Time to Actually Watch the TV
#### Find specific textual examples: analysis of conventions

- Voyeurism and paranoia
	- Encoded into the **overall aesthetic** of the show (setting etc.)
		- Similar colour palette
		- Dark grey/brown bleak - Desaturated
		- Interesting what is borrowed from classical noir to modern noir
		- Living amongst detritus and urbanised concrete jungle
- *Conventions of Nordic Noir (i.e. slow and deliberate pacing) are foregone in periods of "intense moments" (using conventions from action films like shakycam) to disrupt the aesthetic*
- Paranoia aesthetic
- Cornering or blocking of the subject within the structure of the shot. Dramatic Irony also applicable.
	- Blurring the lines between the real and hyperreal. Baudrillard
- Contemporary Attitudes towards LGBT Issues (plus perennial issues)
- Breaking up the reigon of "Scandanavia" as a homogenous mass

> "Time which should otherwise be spent in prayer. Or washing Father Humphrey's 1962 Alpha Romeo. Which is itself a form of prayer, is it not sister?"
