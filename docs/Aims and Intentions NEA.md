**Use evidence from your research into: similar products; the industry context; your target audience, as well as theoretical perspectives, to explain your decisions:**

*My music video will aim to use the conventions of a typical music video to tell a structured narrative, while also providing a varied and engaging performance element.*


**· How and why will you construct representations of individuals, groups and issues/events?**

*I'll be appealing to an audience of young adults, and will select elements in line with a stereotypical indie song -- drawing attention to themes of identity, limerance and escapism, which are prevelant in similar works for the demographic. The representation of these themes will be done via recontextualising the personal lyrics of the song to ...  in the immediate environment, which the protagonist of the video will interact with. *


**· How and why will you use media language in your cross-media production?**

Media language should...

*I will attempt to make use of a mixture of techniques to augment the environment of the video, such as light practical and digital effects -- in order to capture an otherworldly feel. I will also use a varied pace of editing to help punctuate the overarching narrative, a light use of intertextuality, symbolic imagery and a mixture of shot types and locations to help keep the video engaging.*

I will use colour grading techniques to represent the emotions of each shot e.g. the sad shots will have a blue hue and the angry shots will have deeper black values.

**· How will you target your intended audience?**
***


It will appeal to a teen audience as the main actors are teenagers and the alternative music and subtle dark themes (e.g. suicide represented by the bloody hand hanging over the bath, cultist imagery to imply forced changes and oppression) play into current teenage culture where mental health is a large topic of discussion. I will imply suicide through bloody shots but will not outright show any action of self-harm, only the aftermath.

The use different paint colours also imply confusion in sexuality in relation to LGBT symbolism of the colours, as well as general confusion linking to the change a teenager goes through in finding themselves and how labels can be applied to them (like the cultists apply the paint).

I will mainly use hard cuts to not distract from the subject matter in shot but also to keep the target audience’s attention throughout the video.

Lip syncing shots will be intercut with disturbing imagery of blood and voyeuristic POV shots of the female body (ref to Mulvey) to keep attention on the video and create an unsettling feeling in the audience. This links to conventions of the horror genre as they often have a disturbing focus on harming females.

**· How will your production conform to its industry context?**

*By establishing credibility as an indie film/lifestyle magazine and I would absolutely love to and be a fine man*
My video will conform to industry standards by having the elements of a stereotypical alternative indie song which challenges and creates talk around important societal issues as well as creating a ’different’ video which stands out.

I will use a mixture of camera angles to create an attention capturing video. For example, I will use lots of mid shots and close ups of my main actor to establish him as the focus and to show emotion through the shots. I will also film in multiple locations to contrast the image of the main character that is presented in each location e.g. depressed in the bath vs at ease in a park.

**· How will your cross-media production demonstrate digital convergence?**
*For the magazine element, I intend to create a lifestyle magazine that is relevant to both my chosen demographic of young adults -- and conforms to its relevant industry context. For this I intend to use a bolder, minimalist design language that bucks some familliar design trends in magazines, and establish its credibility as a magazine for the chosen demographic. Behind the scenes photos of the music video will be used to cultivate interest, and the content itself will be a fairly casually written interview about the song and the video's production. This will be in service to the perception of an artist with a lack of ideological baggage, an important factor to the demographic.*

I will demonstrate cross-media digital convergence by creating a magazine front cover and double page spread. I will use this to explain the themes of suicide, depression, change and oppression seen throughout the video. I will link this to the artist and any goals or experiences they have when exploring these themes.
