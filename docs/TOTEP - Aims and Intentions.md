My music video will attempt to incorporate the codes and conventions of music videos into a narrative performance. This should present themes of resilience in the face of adversity.

I intend for the video's presentation to adhere closely to the conventions used in the alternative indie genre, in a way that will appeal to the target demographic.
- uses indie genre
- uses horror genre
- talks about resilience

I will aim to represent a core contrast between the main 'protagonist' of the video (who will be a young middle class girl), and the 'antagonist/unknown' (which will be represented by a symbolic monster and the presentation of the environment i.e. city streets). I hope to use production elements like mise-en-scene, lighting techniques and camera angles to reinforce these roles and create a clear narrative that is still open to interpretation and can resonate with individuals.

I feel this slight sinister and mysterious presentation combined with the themes I'm trying to communicate, will be appealing to my target demographic as both elements are prevalent in other media texts advertised to them.

- representation of youth
	- female actor interacting with monster
	- opposition between the two yet they are getting along
- representation of resilience in the face of adversity
- will represent the outer world as mysterious and scary

In service to this, I intend to use a variety of shot types, an unsettling slow edit to the music and dark lighting -- using the language of music videos...
- mixture of shots
- unsettling pace
- old-style vintage colour grading
	- intertextuality with vintage horror films and surrealist elements
- variety of filming locations
- lighting in the dark
	- primarily taking place in dusk/night
- tracking shots

My magazine will mirror many of the themes I have attempted to put forward in my music video, adhering to the same type of conventions. However, I intend to...  Alternative-pop culture signifiers will be used to appeal to the target demographic


- magazine will be refined

- subvert some magazine conventions conform to others
