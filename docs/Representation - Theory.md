## Representation
#examtechnique #theory 
### 1. *Encoding and decoding*  - Stuart Hall
*Potentially applies to: All Media*

Representation is constructed through [Media Language - Theory](Media%20Language%20-%20Theory) (they're linked **definitely**. Media Language is the *framework* by which representation is *constructed*). 

The text will reflect the ideological perspective of the producer.

Stereotyping occurs when there are imbalances of power. The dominated group is seen as ‘other’ or if they're reduced to simple characteristics or traits. More of a generic theorem.

### 2. *Ethnic/Racial Stereotypes Theory* - Alvarado 
*Potentially applies to: All Media*

*Representations of ethnic groups tend to fall into 4 categories: *
- Exotic  - Different, sexualised, objectified, us v them, not as developed.
- Dangerous - Links to the exotic point from above.
- Humorous - Comedic relief, distilling, giving a race single characteristic
- Pitied - Poverty porn, they are lesser, no discussion

This is often in older media groups. Focussed on race.

### 3. *Femenist Theory* - Liesbet van Zoonen
*Potentially applies to: All Media*

*Gender is constructed through codes and conventions of media products.*

The idea of what is male and what is female changes over time. 

Women’s bodies are used in media products as a spectacle for heterosexual male audiences, which reinforces Patriarchal Hegemony. Focussed on gender.

### 4. *Theories of Identity* - David Gauntlett
*Potentially applies to: All Media*

*Audiences can chew around the ideology the same way you chew around raisins in a cookie.*

Audiences can pick and mix which ideologies and representations suit them, and just completely ignore the elements of the product which they do not agree with. 

They completely (or at least try to completely) reject the *preferred reading* cultivated for them by the producer.

### 5. *Feminist Theory* - Bell Hooks
*Potentially applies to: All Media*

*Feminism, the political movement.*

> "No matter how sophisticated our strategies of critique and intervention, \[we\] are usually seduced, at least for a time, by the images we see on the screen. *They have power over us, and we have no power over them.*"

Hooks tells us that feminism is a constant fight to end patriarchal hegemony and the domination of women. Feminism is not a lifestyle choice: it is a political commitment. 

It belongs to everyone and not just for those who identify as women, because of the close intrinsic tie between race, class and gender. All can be exploited.

### 6. *Gender Performativity* - Judith Butler (stan)
*Potentially applies to: All Media*

*Contrapoints who? Identity is a performance, and Tabby isn't Justine, actually.*

Biological differences aren't the tenet by which gender is decided. It's the series of acts we partake in, the way we walk, talk, dress, mentally breakdown, etc. that make up a societally approved identity that we refer to as gender.

Gender performativity is a ritual that is outlined and inforced by the domininant patriarchal ideologies.

### 7. *Postcolonialism* - Paul Gilroy
*Potentially applies to: All Media*

*Connecting domestic conceptions of gaijin to the imperial reach of colonialism*
