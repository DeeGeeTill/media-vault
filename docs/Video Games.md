## Introduction
Video games are a **relatively new** industry, that is intrinsically linked to **technological progress**. In recent years, this technological progress has made video games *far more viable* in terms of *economic performance*, which has bred innovation throughout the sector (and controversy, see more on [Video Game Classification](Video%20Game%20Classification) for that). Video games have gone from small moving lights on a television screen, to showing **complex narratives**, *~~parasocial~~ multiplayer experiences* and unprecendented **cultural capital and potential**.

Video games are most culturally significant in **Japan, Europe and North America**. (Although they are definitely still relevant outside of those areas).

## More quickfire notes on Games
-   Many games are **franchises**.
	-   Video games are heckin hard to make.
	-   Better to reuse mechanics and artwork between games and cultivate a fanatical audience ([Audiences](Audiences)) than reinvent the wheel every year.
	-   [Media Language - Theory#3 Genre Theory - Steve Neale](Media%20Language%20-%20Theory#3%20Genre%20Theory%20-%20Steve%20Neale)
-   Games often have **intertextual references/convergance** and are linked to another product such as a book, film, comic etc.
-   Media conglomerates **create synergy** as they often produce *multiple formats* that can all come together, e.g. Sony is responsible for music, film, and games.
-   The same game is more often than not **released on multiple platforms** (XBOX, PS4 etc).
-   Players often have *avatars* in game that are a digital representation of themselves inside the world.
-   Many games have â€˜persistentâ€™ worlds and are multiplayer, meaning that the game world continues even after a player logs off.

## Some More Key Terms
- Proliferation is when a successful product is copied relentlessly (a rip off). It's the price for success.
