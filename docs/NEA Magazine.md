We're making a **mainstream** magazine. That's unhelpful because they are all kind fo mainstream... by virtue of them being magazines... but also they're meant to be **lifestyle** magazines. 

It should be a **front cover** and double-page spread

It should look quite a bit like a music magazine, but with a few extra topics popped into them.

#### Distinctive Features
- Overlapping foreground with background graphics
- Original Magazine Title and Masthead
- Strapline
- Give the artist a new name, backstory and image (people in our music video) owo
- Cover price/barcode etc.
- You *cannot have stills from the music video*, but **you can have BTS images** of the set. 
	- Try making some kind of photoshoot on the set.
- **DPS**
	- Suggests half an A3 page be an image.
	- 300 words on the DPS. Columns, rather small. Conform to conventional magazines.
	- We can write whatever we want in the actual article. There must be an interview and something about music video. But conflict/backstory etc. is fine too
	- The article is ABOUT THE MUSIC, MAN.
