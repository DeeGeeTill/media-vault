Don't forget to use a few of the [Revision Strategies](Revision%20Strategies). And we're going to be using texts on [this thing](https://hrsfc.sharepoint.com/sites/MediaY120E02/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?OR=teams&action=edit&sourcedoc={88E7F907-0EE4-4030-AF4D-27894D16CDB5}).

## Breakdown
- Section A: 15marks, 1hr 30mins
	- An unseen text (may or may not have an audiovisual component).
	- Comparative representation question -- talking about one of our texts and one unseen.
	- ((2 Music Videos, Kiss of the Vampire, Tide, Brexit))
- Section B - Industry and Audience: 45 minutes: 
	- First two are asking about terminology explanations (stepped questions). 
	- 3-4 will be based around the same texts on different things
	- ((AC:Liberation, Tide, WaterAid, I Daniel Blake, TheTimes/Mirror Megxit))
		- Advertising, film marketing, newspaper, radio.

## Advice
- Give enough time to unseen components
- Revise *all of the texts*, that we've done so far.
- Anything below 10 marks - don't bother with introductions
	- Focus on getting *as much information down as you can*.

## Key Concepts
1. Media Language
2. Representation
3. Industry
