Midori Perry's latest song, The One True Path, was released to little fanfare this past Tuesday. In it she introduces a fresh and unexpectedly dark sound for fans of her usually eclectic electric pop style. Curveballing audiences with a minor key, cold synths, and a spooky bass line. It's a slow burner, and takes its time reaching a real payoff.

She has also, in an uncharacteristic move, decided to premiere a music video for the track, which I had the honour to talk with her further about this afternoon. "There's a time and place for personas and mystery. I really wanted to say something with this."

When asked what the video was about she commented quickly: "it's about childhood, facing your fears, all that good stuff!"

"I based the premise on a nightmare I had "

The Video
A lot of people have asked what the meaning of the video was?
"(chuckles) Well, the video was inspired by a nightmare I had. I was dealing with some pretty dark stuff at the time. I told my family, friends and producers and they all kind of identified with parts of it. My team helped me put kind of a positive spin on it. And that anecdote is what I think (the video is) about at the end of the day, taking fears and doubts and learning to face them and deal with them healthily."

- what's the message of the music video?
	- inspired by a nightmare i had
	- i wanted to face that nightmare and my fears
	- that's a really important thing that not many people talk about
