### An Analysis...
> #### Quick Reference
> - Check out the [Formation Andrew Goodwin Analysis](Formation%20Andrew%20Goodwin%20Analysis)
> - We did a few activities on this topic.

#### Core Points
These are points you can just whip out at any opportunity when talking about Formation. This covers the subsection: *Component 1 Section A*  ( #examtechnique ) assessment talking points. Yes I copy-and-pasted this from Riptide, no I refuse to apologise.


#### Media language
> ##### Theorists talking about Media Lang
> - [Media Language - Theory#1 Semiotics - Roland Barthes](Media%20Language%20-%20Theory#1%20Semiotics%20-%20Roland%20Barthes)
> - [Media Language - Theory#4 Structuralism - Calude Levi-Stauss](Media%20Language%20-%20Theory#4%20Structuralism%20-%20Calude%20Levi-Stauss)

-  Use of fast-paced, rapid-fire editing to enhance/construct *pacing*
-  Use of *montage* positions the audience in an a historical space. 
	- Jumps between 1800’s antebellum era America to 1980’s parking lots...
-  Use of a variety of post production editing techniques, including VHS grain, connoting a rough and edgy ideology
	-  Emulating analogue technology for what purpose?
-  [Media Language - Theory#4 Structuralism - Calude Levi-Stauss|Binary oppositions](Media%20Language%20-%20Theory#4%20Structuralism%20-%20Calude%20Levi-Stauss|Binary%20oppositions) constructed between downtrodden black underclass *and the threat of the white police force*
- Footage utilised from _That B.E.A.T_ functions as an informative and attractive referential code

#### Representation
> ##### Theorists talking about Rep
> - [Representation - Theory#1 Encoding and decoding - Stuart Hall](Representation%20-%20Theory#1%20Encoding%20and%20decoding%20-%20Stuart%20Hall)
> - [Representation - Theory#4 Theories of Identity - David Gauntlett](Representation%20-%20Theory#4%20Theories%20of%20Identity%20-%20David%20Gauntlett)
> - [Representation - Theory#3 Femenist Theory - Liesbet van Zoonen](Representation%20-%20Theory#3%20Femenist%20Theory%20-%20Liesbet%20van%20Zoonen) & [Representation - Theory#5 Feminist Theory - Bell Hooks](Representation%20-%20Theory#5%20Feminist%20Theory%20-%20Bell%20Hooks)
> - [Representation - Theory#7 Postcolonialism - Paul Gilroy](Representation%20-%20Theory#7%20Postcolonialism%20-%20Paul%20Gilroy)

-  Black working class identity **encoded** through costume, setting and _mise-en-scene_
-  A range of *stereotypical and subversive* representations of ethnicity, drawing from a postcolonial perspective of race and ethnicity
	-  Subversion for the purpose of showcasing evolution of the ethnic underclass possibly?
-  Heavy use of sexualisation, highly *paradigmatic of the genre*, **encoded** through costume and gesture
-  *Postmodern mixture* of antebellum slave owner costumes mixed with contemporary representations of working class black **identity**, deliberately reinforcing "controversial" binary oppositions
-  Representation of the American deep south: poverty, deprivation and an ‘edgy’ aesthetic. *Challenging* and respectful or simply an *appropriation of working class culture* by a millionaire?
