## Categories of Theorist
We can help leverage theorists with the help of the *core media tenets*. So basically...

- [Media Language - Theory](Media%20Language%20-%20Theory) - The framework by which media is communicated and by which **meaning can be extracted**.
- [Representation - Theory](Representation%20-%20Theory) - How does the text deal with and present particular **groups**, *ideologies*, **experiences** or *topics*.
- [Media Industries](Media%20Industries) - Who is the media **controlled by**, and *why* is it done that way? How is media **profitable**?
- [Audiences](Audiences) - The people that receive the media text, what are its **effects** on them?
