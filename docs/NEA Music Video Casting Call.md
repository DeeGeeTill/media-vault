## Shotlist
#### Overarching Plot: Video Treatment
1. Establishing shots of a CGI rendered city at dawn. The world is moving slowly. Cars, trains, buses and other things are whizzing about.
2. (ðŸŽµ Can't see the light inside my head now): We're introduced to our "protagonist", an individual who appears to be selling some kind of salad product at a market. They are tired and roll into the back of the frame.
3. (First Chorus). They are now in some kind of abstract nature world. Performance footage is intercut with the natural wonder of wherever they are (CAMBRIDGE BOTANICAL GARDEN??? THAT COULD BE VERY NIFTY).
4. (ðŸŽµ Head down). The individual is back in the city. They are selling food at their market. Business is good. A few objects on their windowsill showcase the fact that they like nature (think the lorax right?)
5. Repeat part 3. for the first chorus.
6. As the chorus breaks into a minor key change, the individual has found a switch/McGuffin of some sorts in their fantasy world. It appears to start growing natural things in their city. 
7. Bliss as the song fades out. The camera does a reverse-establishing shot kind of thing, and then leaves. 

OK Change of plan. Maybe this is more like a love for pets type thing? Maybe their talking about a dog? Gotta be careful with that, I don't want them to sound like they want to fuck their dog.

### Revelations
This is just a place to get some shit down whilst I still remember it. You can pretty this up a little bit later...

- The limerent object is kind of *non-existant* at the moment, so I'm thinking of "materialising it" in the form of having **Jack** appear in the video. (pets help personify the disconnect between nature and reality)
- Measure the video's length not in seconds but in **beats of the song**. That way we have a metric for whether things are interesting or not
- I'm worried about the shots moving too fast and the audience not having enough time to process information. It's quite a slow song, so I should keep these things to a minimum
- Story arc
	- We follow a resident of a cyberpunk world through their day, as they slip into daydreaming
	- This represents ????
		- A dichotomy about reality vs fiction
		- A commentary on isolation when surrounded by people
		- A commentary on isolation during the Coronavirus pandemic (although this is a little gauche)

## Next Steps
- [ ] Just to make and time a storyboard, iterate on it, and continue... right?
