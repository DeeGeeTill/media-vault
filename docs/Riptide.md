### An Analysis...
> #### Quick Reference
> - Check out the [Riptide Andrew Goodwin Analysis](Riptide%20Andrew%20Goodwin%20Analysis)
> - This was so indicitave of [Postmodernism](Postmodernism) they used it to introduce the topic.
> - We did a few activities on this topic.

#### Core Points
These are points you can just whip out at any opportunity when talking about Riptide. This covers the subsection: *Component 1 Section A*  ( #examtechnique ) assessment talking points.


#### Media language
> ##### Theorists talking about Media Lang
> - [Media Language - Theory#1 Semiotics - Roland Barthes](Media%20Language%20-%20Theory#1%20Semiotics%20-%20Roland%20Barthes)
> - [Media Language - Theory#4 Structuralism - Calude Levi-Stauss](Media%20Language%20-%20Theory#4%20Structuralism%20-%20Calude%20Levi-Stauss)


-  Rapid fire **montage** creates a range of **discontinuous meanings through association**. Punctuating the points.
-  Heavy use of *intertextuality*, like classic horror and slasher films and franchises
-  Highly saturated *technicolour* juxtaposed with *faded colours* reminiscent of 1970â€™s cinema
-  Subversive elements include a **complete lack of performance,** and deliberately poor lip synching
-  A [Postmodernism](Postmodernism)-filled deconstruction of music videos?

#### Representation
> ##### Theorists talking about Rep
> - [Representation - Theory#1 Encoding and decoding - Stuart Hall](Representation%20-%20Theory#1%20Encoding%20and%20decoding%20-%20Stuart%20Hall)
> - [Representation - Theory#4 Theories of Identity - David Gauntlett](Representation%20-%20Theory#4%20Theories%20of%20Identity%20-%20David%20Gauntlett)
> - [Representation - Theory#3 Femenist Theory - Liesbet van Zoonen](Representation%20-%20Theory#3%20Femenist%20Theory%20-%20Liesbet%20van%20Zoonen) & [Representation - Theory#5 Feminist Theory - Bell Hooks](Representation%20-%20Theory#5%20Feminist%20Theory%20-%20Bell%20Hooks)
> - [Representation - Theory#7 Postcolonialism - Paul Gilroy](Representation%20-%20Theory#7%20Postcolonialism%20-%20Paul%20Gilroy)

-  Frequent, **highly voyeuristic** and **highly sexualised** images of women in perilous situations. Damsel in distress.
-  _Mise-en-scene_ showcasing running makeup, rope and torture devices represent women *in a sexually fetishistic and vulnerable way*.  Yikes.
	-  Challenging or simply sexist?
-  Audience consistently positioned through POV and tracking shots, *anchoring* the interpretation that they are  **complicit** in the menacing of the women/women in the industry in general.
-  Women are consistently represented as *hegemonically attractive,* blonde, tall, and white. Aryan. Wait, no...
-  Lack of anchorage however allows producers to sidestep accusations of sexism? Potentially, if unfavourable.

### Activities
If you're viewing this publically, this may be private. These are for my own personal use, and I don't always feel comfortable having everyone see my things. Sorry :)).

- To what extent [is Riptide sexist](is%20Riptide%20sexist) or perpetuating hegemonic ideology?
- To what extent [is Riptide postmodern](is%20Riptide%20postmodern)?
