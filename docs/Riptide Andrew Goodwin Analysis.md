### Andrew Goodwin Practice
This is by no means a final point list, but it is an example of what we did in class:

1. **Links between music and visuals (literal, amplified or oppositional) **
	1. On beat cuts - genre convention
	2. Dark sky coinciding with diminishing chords (?) as video continues. A bad omen?
	3. Juxtaposition and referencing constantly used.
2. **Links between lyrics and visuals (literal, amplified or oppositional) **
	1. Closely interlaced link for recontextualisation - *punctuation* of visuals
		1. See also: the gradual increase in the "can be used as weapon" factor as the video continues
		2. Charioscuro used to darken these objects, media language signalling sinister
	2. At points directly captioning the lyrics
	3. 'Awoo!' - A ghost! Stock Footage
3. **Genre characteristics **
	1. *Experimental nature* giving indie credance. Indie swag. Indie clout.
	2. Picking and choosing *which conventions to follow or subvert* - subverting gender roles and industry expectations keeping generic simple pop melodic structure.
4. **Inter-textual references **
	1. Horror films - slasher franchise - Blair Witch - Tarot Cards - Ouija Board - Being dragged into the back of the frame
	2. References to Technicolour and 80s films, target demographic *nostalgia*?
		1. 70s and 80s slashers/horrors, 60s instructional videos, 2010s nostalgia goggles
	3. Michelle Pfipheroef (idk how to spell it)
5. **Themes of looking and voyeurism **
	1. Ew, too much.
		1. Audience is complicit in intimate scenes, and at angles unnatural to the traditionally omniscient position (e.g. when the singer is singing, we're at a 3/4 angle implying another audience we can't see, matching the singer's eyeline).
	2. See Michekebigkeg phuieglheuig again.
	3. Core *tenet* of the video, practically the "thesis" behind it, a criticism of the voyeurstic nature of the music industry, or potentially j the audience or potentially... polysemic
6. **Demands of the record label **
	1. Signed to *Atlantic Records* an R&B based Rap Label
		1. Branching out to Indie
		2.  ___foregrounding of artist is not present as is customary?___ more of a hitchcockian cemo
7. **Performance, narrative or concept based **
	1. Surrealist *concept based* that just so happens to *construct a narrative,* with the tools given.
