Our brief is from *Advertising and Marketing: Music*. Creating a music video + magazine front cover + magazine double page spread interview (with the person presenting as the artist in the music video). 

The **deadline** is the *end of the first half-term.*

> Note: The music video and magazine are both **marked together**. 

You must pick a song **that doesn't already have an OFFICIAL music video**.
